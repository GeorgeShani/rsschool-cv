## Code Examples

### Codewars Solution: Convert String to CamelCase

**Problem:** Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing.

```javascript
// Convert string to camelCase
function toCamelCase(str) {
  let words = str.split(/[-_\s]+/);
  return words[0].toLowerCase() +
    words.slice(1).map(w => w.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + w.slice(1).toLowerCase()).join('');
}

// Examples:
console.log(toCamelCase("the-stealth-warrior")); // "theStealthWarrior"
console.log(toCamelCase("The_Stealth_Warrior"));  // "theStealthWarrior"
console.log(toCamelCase("A-B-C"));                // "aBC"
```
